#The intent of this application is to walk users through creating on itemized list of tasks that can be modified based on completion and necessity.
# Menu1 is adding tasks to a list through input
# Menu2 is printing said list itemized
# Menu3 is moving tasks from To-Do list to Completed and removing them from the first list
# Menu4 is deleting a task from To-Do list
# Menu5 is exiting app
# BONUS: Prioritize tasks, add due dates, color-coding tasks based on status.
